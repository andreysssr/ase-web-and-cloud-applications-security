# CRUD ASP.NET MVC Core Application

## Creating the Database Classes

> The database context class is the bridge between the application and the EF Core and provides access to the application’s data using model objects.

1. Add a class file called `ApplicationDbContext.cs` to the `Data` folder and defined the class shown bellow.

    ```C#
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
	{
		public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options): base(options) { }
		public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
	}
    ```

    The `DbContext` base class provides access to the Entity Framework Core’s underlying functionality, and the `Products` property will provide access to the `Product` objects in the database.

## Creating the Repository Class

4. The next step is to create a class that implements the IProductRepository interface and gets its data using Entity Framework Core.

    ```C#
    public class EFProductRepository : IProductRepository
	{
		private ApplicationDbContext context;
		
        public EFProductRepository(ApplicationDbContext ctx)
		{
			context = ctx;
		}

        public IQueryable<Product> Products
		{
			get
			{
				return context.Products;
			}
		}
	}
    ```

## Defining the Connection String

1. Create an empty database using the SQL Server Explorer panel.

2. Add an `appsettings.json` file using the ASP.NET Configuration File item template in the ASP.NET section of the Add New Item window.

    > A connection string specifies the location and name of the database and provides configuration settings for how the application should connect to the database server.

    ```
    {
         "ConnectionStrings": {
            "DefaultConnection": "...."
        }
    }
    ```
3. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`

## Configuring the Application

1. Add the following code to the `Startup` class

    ```C#
    private IConfiguration Configuration;
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }
    ```
2. Update the `ConfigureServices` method in the `Startup` class as follows.

    ```C#
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        //services.AddTransient<IProductRepository, FakeProductRepository>();

        services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(
                Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

        services.AddTransient<IProductRepository, EFProductRepository>();

        services.AddMvc();
    }
    ```

    > Hint: If `UseSqlServer` is not recognized, install the package `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`

## Creating and Applying the Database Migration

1. Run the following command to generate the initial migration using the `Package Manager Console` panel.

    ```
    Add-Migration Initial
    ```
    > If the command is not recognized, install the package `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` 

2. Run the following command to update the database.

    ```
    Update-Database
    ```

## Creating the Seed Data

3. To populate the database and provide some sample data, let's add a class file called `SeedData.cs` to the `Data` folder.

    > Futher details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/sql

    ```C#
    public class SeedData
    {
        public static async Task SeedAsync(ApplicationDbContext context)
        {
            // Look for any products.
            if (context.Products.Any())
            {
                return;   // DB has been seeded
            }

            context.Products.AddRange(
                new Product
                {
                    Name = "Kayak",
                    Description = "A boat for one person",
                    Category = "Watersports",
                    Price = 275
                },
                new Product
                {
                    Name = "Lifejacket",
                    Description = "Protective and fashionable",
                    Category = "Watersports",
                    Price = 48.95m
                },
                new Product
                {
                    Name = "Soccer Ball",
                    Description = "FIFA-approved size and weight",
                    Category = "Soccer",
                    Price = 19.50m
                },
                new Product
                {
                    Name = "Corner Flags",
                    Description = "Give your playing field a professional touch",
                    Category = "Soccer",
                    Price = 34.95m
                }
            );

            await context.SaveChangesAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

4. Let's update the `Main` method of the `Program` class as follows.

    ```C#
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var host = CreateHostBuilder(args).Build();

        using (var scope = host.Services.CreateScope())
        {
            var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
            var loggerFactory = services.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>();
            try
            {
                var context = services.GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>();
                await SeedData.SeedAsync(context);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();
                logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred seeding the DB.");
            }
        }

        host.Run();
    }
    ```
3. Update the `ConfigureServices` method in the `Startup` class to use `EFProductRepository` instead of `FakeProductRepository`

    ```C#
    services.AddTransient<IProductRepository, EFProductRepository>();
    ```

# Deleting the database

1. Whenever you want to delete the content of the database, you can use the following query.

    ```SQL
    /* Azure friendly */
    /* Drop all Foreign Key constraints */
    DECLARE @name VARCHAR(128)
    DECLARE @constraint VARCHAR(254)
    DECLARE @SQL VARCHAR(254)

    SELECT @name = (SELECT TOP 1 TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'FOREIGN KEY' ORDER BY TABLE_NAME)

    WHILE @name is not null
    BEGIN
        SELECT @constraint = (SELECT TOP 1 CONSTRAINT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND TABLE_NAME = @name ORDER BY CONSTRAINT_NAME)
        WHILE @constraint IS NOT NULL
        BEGIN
            SELECT @SQL = 'ALTER TABLE [dbo].[' + RTRIM(@name) +'] DROP CONSTRAINT [' + RTRIM(@constraint) +']'
            EXEC (@SQL)
            PRINT 'Dropped FK Constraint: ' + @constraint + ' on ' + @name
            SELECT @constraint = (SELECT TOP 1 CONSTRAINT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND CONSTRAINT_NAME <> @constraint AND TABLE_NAME = @name ORDER BY CONSTRAINT_NAME)
        END
    SELECT @name = (SELECT TOP 1 TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'FOREIGN KEY' ORDER BY TABLE_NAME)
    END
    GO

    /* Drop all Primary Key constraints */
    DECLARE @name VARCHAR(128)
    DECLARE @constraint VARCHAR(254)
    DECLARE @SQL VARCHAR(254)

    SELECT @name = (SELECT TOP 1 TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'PRIMARY KEY' ORDER BY TABLE_NAME)

    WHILE @name IS NOT NULL
    BEGIN
        SELECT @constraint = (SELECT TOP 1 CONSTRAINT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'PRIMARY KEY' AND TABLE_NAME = @name ORDER BY CONSTRAINT_NAME)
        WHILE @constraint is not null
        BEGIN
            SELECT @SQL = 'ALTER TABLE [dbo].[' + RTRIM(@name) +'] DROP CONSTRAINT [' + RTRIM(@constraint)+']'
            EXEC (@SQL)
            PRINT 'Dropped PK Constraint: ' + @constraint + ' on ' + @name
            SELECT @constraint = (SELECT TOP 1 CONSTRAINT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'PRIMARY KEY' AND CONSTRAINT_NAME <> @constraint AND TABLE_NAME = @name ORDER BY CONSTRAINT_NAME)
        END
    SELECT @name = (SELECT TOP 1 TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE constraint_catalog=DB_NAME() AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'PRIMARY KEY' ORDER BY TABLE_NAME)
    END
    GO

    /* Drop all tables */
    DECLARE @name VARCHAR(128)
    DECLARE @SQL VARCHAR(254)

    SELECT @name = (SELECT TOP 1 [name] FROM sysobjects WHERE [type] = 'U' AND category = 0 ORDER BY [name])

    WHILE @name IS NOT NULL
    BEGIN
        SELECT @SQL = 'DROP TABLE [dbo].[' + RTRIM(@name) +']'
        EXEC (@SQL)
        PRINT 'Dropped Table: ' + @name
        SELECT @name = (SELECT TOP 1 [name] FROM sysobjects WHERE [type] = 'U' AND category = 0 AND [name] > @name ORDER BY [name])
    END
    GO
    ```
